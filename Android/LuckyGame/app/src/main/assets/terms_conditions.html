<li><strong>SpinDeals Rewards.</strong> SpinDeals from time to time may offer one or more rewards or loyalty programs.SpinDeals reserves the right to terminate Offers and Rewards, or to change the conditions governing the Offers and Rewards, regulations, or benefits of participation, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice, even though changes may affect the amount of Offers and Rewards already accumulated.SpinDeals may also withdraw, limit, modify or cancel the amount of Offers and Rewards required for redemption of other benefits, or change the number or type of offers and Rewards offered.SpinDeals will have final decision should any disputes over Offers and Rewards arise. SpinDeals reserves the right to terminate a User’s Account and cancel accrued Offers and Rewards if SpinDeals believes, in its sole discretion, that the User is abusing the Offers/Rewards program, or is misrepresenting any information furnished to SpinDeals. Should SpinDeals offer Rewards from any partners, such as third-parties, <strong>SpinDeals will not be responsible for any partner’s participation in or withdrawal from the Offers/Rewards program.</strong> Offers/ Rewards from two separate Accounts may not be combined. Users are solely responsible for any tax liability related to participation in any Offers/Rewards program.</li>
<li><strong><strong><strong><strong>Redemption. To redeem and use any Discounts or Offers, User must present the mobile phone on which such offer was awarded to representatives of the relevant partner, and if requested, User must provide to such partner representative the relevant redemption code as indicated on the offer.</strong></strong></strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Must Be Present. User, along with User’s mobile phone, must be present at the relevant store to use an offer for that Store. USER MUST ENSURE TO BE ONLINE AT THE TIME OF REDEMPTION IN ORDER TO REDEEM OFFER.</strong> We may notify User by email, as well as terminate User’s Account, after a “false use” report that the User was not present to redeem an Offer, whether or not that was in fact the case.

<li><strong>Duration of Offers.</strong> SpinDeals Offers are valid only during certain times, as indicated in the SpinDeals App and may be altered with or without notice at the sole discretion of SpinDeals and its partners.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution of Offers.</strong> SpinDeals uses a spinning function to randomly award specified offers to Users. Subject to availability, each User may receive only one or more chances to win an offer per day for each store. SpinDeals, in its sole discretion, may use any method of randomly awarding Offers to Users. Offers change constantly and SpinDeals provides no guarantee regarding the amount/number of Offers that User may receive. SpinDeals reserves the right to grant different Offers to different Users at any time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Other Offers. Offers shall not be combined with any other offer or deal of the Store.</strong></strong></li>
<li><strong><strong>Additional Terms. Additional terms may apply to each specific offer and/or Store. Please read the Coupon Terms prior to use.</strong></strong></li>
<li><strong><strong>No Guarantee. The Stores are third party non-affiliates of SpinDeals and SpinDeals cannot guarantee that a participating Partner/store will honor an offer. SpinDeals is not responsible or liable for any Store’s refusal to honor an offer. The Sites rely on a network connection and computer software, and SpinDeals shall not be liable for User’s inability to use an offer resulting from a malfunction of such.
